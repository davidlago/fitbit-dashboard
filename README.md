## Fitbit Dashboard
This is a sandbox project where I play around with the Fitbit API. If you
want to run it, make sure you set up the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to
`development` or `production`, and the `FITBIT_API_KEY` and `FITBIT_API_SECRET`
to the appropriate values once you set up your application
[here](https://dev.fitbit.com).

Also, make sure when you configure your Fitbit app, you point to the callback
URL `https://<YOUR-WEBSITE-URL-HERE>/connect/fitbit/callback`.
